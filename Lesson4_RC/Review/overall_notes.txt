collections - structured container for storing data
collections - lists of data
collections - made up of individual elements


REFERENCING & ASSIGNING

strings use an integer based index, starting at 0.

Arrays are index ordered list of elements.
 to maintain list order, arrays use integer-based index.


SLICE METHOD: distinction returns a new string, returns a new array*
	*unless a single element is referenced, then that element will be returned


Hashes: use key-value pairs (more exanpsive & descriptive collection of elements)



OUT OF BOUNDS INDICES:
for strings we know nil is an INVALID VALUE
however for arrays, it coudl be a valid return value.

valid return? or OOB reference?


when reerencing an item by its key you must use the correct object type.


Element Assignement:

___________

We can tell 'loop' to iterate a specific number of times by using a variable that tracks the number of iterations performed.

"" in order to prince each character in the string, we need to iterate over the entire string, and use string reference to retrieve each letters based on inders.

LOOP COMPRISES OF FOUR BASIC ELEMENTS
L O O P <- four elements
Loop
Counter
Way to retrieve the current value
Way to exit the loop.

selection & transformation

Besided iteration, the two most common actions to perform on a collection are

Selection & Transformation


Selecion - is picking certain elements out of a collection based on some criterion

Transformation - manipulating every element in the collection.

SELECTION - if there are 'n' elements in a collection, selection results in n or less elements

TRANSFORMATION - always results in exactly n elements

Selection & Transformation utilize the basics of looping:
1 Loop
2 Counter
3 Way to retrieve the current value
4 Way to exit the loop
plus - both require some criteria
	s -> determine which elements are selected
	t -> how to perform the operation


______________

each sends the value of the current element to the block in the form of an argument
in this block, the argument to the block is 'num'

the last expression within the method, puts always returns nil

we can use methods provided by Ruby to allow for simpler implementations of common collection manipulation tasks.



the method only returns true if the block's return value is EVERY iterarion is truthy.


as of Ruby 1.9 order is preserved in ruby according to the order of insertion.



we can determine the block's return value by looking at the return value of the last statement evaluated within the block.
