LESSON 6:  Slightly Larger Programs


Approaches:
	1. break problem down into smaller pieces.
	2. Map out the flow of the program in a flowchart, using sub-processes to encapsulate well-defined components of the problem
	3. When you're ready to tackle a component or sub-process, write out the pseudo-code for that sub-process only.
	Come up with clear inputs for the sub-process, and clear outputs you expect from the sub-process.
	4. Play around with the code.  Write every line of code and make sure you understand it.
	5. Do the assignments in sequence.
	6. Don't be afraid of watching the walkthrough videos.



PRY VIDEO NOTES:


require 'pry'
require	'pry-byebug'

we can in terminal command form enter a a variable // cd arr -> pry(#<Array>):1> ls

cd

ls - lists Enum methods, Array methods, self.methods, locals:

---pre-byebug
