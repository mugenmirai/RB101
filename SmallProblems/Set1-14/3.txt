def my_method(a,b=2,c=3,d)
	p [a,b,c,d]
end

my_method(4,5,6)
----

Here we are dealing with default parameters(positional).

as long as at least 2 arguments are supplied to the my_method, we won't have any argument errors.

a = 4
b = 5
c = 3
d = 6

Ruby assigns parameters from left to right, in order.
