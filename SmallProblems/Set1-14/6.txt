5.step(to: 10, by: 3) {|value| puts value }

It will execute the block for each value in the iteration.

This should output to the screen, the returned value of invoking the step method on integer 5.

This will skip to number 10 in increments of 3.

so it should start with 5, then 5+3=8, then stop since the next value will be 11 going over 10.


#NUMERIC!!!!

calling .superclass helped me get to this solution.
