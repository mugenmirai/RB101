Positional Arguments are filled out first, then the default arguments are set with any values supplied, and finally default values are applied to anything remaining.
In this exercise x x x are assigned to the positional arguments a b d
x overrides the default for balue b, c is not set to any of the listed values, and is assigned default value x.


#bsearch

takes only one argument (block) returns an element of the array, block is required, and that it takes one argument.
operating in what is called "FIND-MINIMUM MODE"

multiple lines in a signature indicates that an argument is optional.
Array#fetch does 'bounds checking' //whether the specified element actually exists before fetching it.

second form returns the value of the default argument if the element does not exist
third form returns the value returned by the block

#step has 4 calling signatures
step 1 takes two keyword arguments(named arguments) :by :to (symbol)
It will execute the block for each value in the iteration.

When looking at docs, check whether a particular method isn't being overridden by the subclass.
