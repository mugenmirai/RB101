#MUTATION
=begin 
using %w() is an esier way to setting up an array.
on line 2 we reference an empty array with the local variable2
on line 3 we call eacn on array1 from line 1, and repolulate all the elements
of array1 to array 2, thust both arrays contain the same amount of elements
we will ignore line 4 since we aren't utlizing any value/returnvalue by calling .each on array since .each method 
returns the orinal array, and we are not outputing anything to the screen.
on line 5 we call puts on array 2, outputting each name on a separate line to the screen.
Return value should be nil.
